Glasswall was approached by a large government agency with a problem: they had terabytes of important data on an isolated network which they believed could contain unknown malicious content. They urgently required access to this data, but the only option available at the time was to ’sheep dip’ it in anti-virus. Understanding that AV only offers limited protection and can leave you exposed to file-based threats for up to 30+ days, they needed a different approach that didn’t rely on legacy detection-based methodologies. They were looking for a solution that would ensure that all this critical data would be safe, secure and accessible.

On the recommendation of a leading UK intelligence agency, they turned to Glasswall to clean the data using its industry-leading Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) platform. 

Unlike reactive security methods such as AV or sandboxing which attempt to identify and block malicious content, Glasswall CDR technology instantly cleans and rebuilds files to match its known good manufacturers specification – automatically removing potential threats.

This proactive approach instantly makes files and documents safe from threats, ensuring prevention against future unknown attacks, eliminating risk without compromising productivity, whilst giving users the freedom to safely access files.
